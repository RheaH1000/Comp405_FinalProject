    	<!-- based on SSSSSHOMEWORK 5 -->

    	<!-- IDEAS

	      		United States (info and design pres)
	      		the Philippines (info and design pres)
	      		Australia
	      		ChiloÃ© Archipelago (Chile)
	      		The Turkic Countries
	      	- refine/rely info on other sites other than wikipedia!
	      	- sources
	      	- the upcoming myths had overall info on them... do so with the other two (use same overview info in final project)
	      	- cite pictures >M< (images - right click and Search Google for Images; background images - code background image as an image again, in intro section and treat it as a reg. image)
    	-->
